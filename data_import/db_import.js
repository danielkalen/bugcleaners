While each termite species thrives in different climates and eats different types of food, all termites require four things to survive — food, moisture, shelter and optimal temperature. Unfortunately, all homes, regardless of their construction type, can provide these ideal conditions for termite infestation. Termites cause extreme damage to structures, often before they are discovered, while colonies may contain up to 2,700 members. And unless an infestation is eradicated, termites can completely destroy the structural integrity of any home or commercial facility.'

Here in the Tri-State area, it is the carpenter ant that causes the greatest amount of damage and general home and commercial infestations. Carpenter ants get their name because they excavate wood in order to build their nests. Their excavation results in smooth tunnels inside the wood. Carpenter ants range in size from one-quarter inch for a worker ant to up to three-quarters inch for a queen.',
				'All species of carpenter ants mainly attack any type of wood that is or has been wet and damaged by mold. Even though these ants first invade wet, decayed wood, they may soon begin building paths through dry, undamaged wood. They will also crawl along overhead wires, shrubs, or tree limbs that touch the building far above the ground. Carpenter ants build their nests outdoors in various wood sources, including tree stumps, firewood or landscaping, and they need a constant water source to survive. And they usually come into buildings through cracks around doors, windows, or through holes for wires.'

Silverfish feed on fungal molds and organic matter. They can damage natural fabrics, paper and book bindings. Treatment of cracks and voids as well as attic and crawl spaces is necessary to minimize silverfish. This pest, however, is one of the most difficult insects to totally eliminate even for a professional company.',

Pigeon droppings can spread common diseases, attracts rodents, blocks gutters, and corrodes structures. Probably the most effective control is exclusion. This, sometimes, is not an easy proposition.  Bridges and other superstructures offer many areas that pigeons enjoy roosting on, and depending on how these structures are built, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to exclude the pigeons.',

Sanitation and prevention are some of the greatest steps you can take in regards to the housefly. Because it frequents unsanitary areas, such as garbage and manure, this fly is considered a possible health risk and its presence indoors should be minimized.',
