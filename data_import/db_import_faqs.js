				{
					'question': 'Why should someone hire BugCleaners instead of attempting to control their pest problems by themselves?',
					'answer': 'Just as you wouldn’t prescribe medicine for yourself or drill your own cavities, you shouldn’t attempt to control termites or other pests on your own. The products and the expertise offered by BugCleaners far surpasses what a homeowner could do on their own.  Leave it up to the experts for peace of mind. Why risk it?'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How difficult are termites to treat?',
					'answer': 'Termites are nearly impossible for homeowners to treat tehmselves.  On the other hand, BugCleaners’s professionals have the training, expertise and technology to eliminate termite colonies and infestations, giving you peace of mind.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What are the different types of termite treatments?',
					'answer': 'There are two primary types of treatments available to BugCleaners customers. The time tested liquid treatment creates a barrier in the soil between the invading subterranean (under ground) termite colony and your home. The alternative treatment is called Sentricon, which is a baiting system. Sentricon is a more “green” approach than a liquid treatment, but both are effective methods of control.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What is the most effective type of termite treatment?',
					'answer': 'A trained and licensed BugCleaners professional is the best person to make a recommendation for each particular property.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What questions should homeowners ask during a professional termite inspection/treatment?',
					'answer': 'What type of treatment is recommended?<br /> How long will the treatment take?<br /> How much will it cost?<br /> How long will it take to get rid of the termites?<br /> What type of contract or guarantee is offered?<br /> Are they a member of the National Pest Management Association?'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What can a homeowner do to prevent termites?',
					'answer': 'Termites love moisture. Eliminate any moisture around the foundation of your home.<br /> Divert water away with properly functioning downspouts, gutters and splash blocks.<br /> Reduce humidity in crawl spaces with proper ventilation.<br /> Prevent shrubs, vines and other vegetation from growing over and onto the home and covering vents.<br /> Be sure to remove old form boards, grade stakes, etc., left in place after the building was constructed. Remove old tree stumps and roots around and beneath the building.<br /> Most importantly, eliminate any wood contact with the soil. An 18-inch gap between the soil and wood portions of the building is ideal.<br /> It doesn’t hurt to routinely inspect the foundation of your home for signs of termite damage.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Can pests other than termites damage property?',
					'answer': 'Absolutely. Carpenter ants, carpenter bees and powder post beetles are all categorized as wood destroying insects.  That’s why it’s important to have a professional identify the source of your problem and provide the most effective treatment to control it.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What is a bed bug?',
					'answer': 'Bed bugs are small, reddish brown, oval, wingless insects that reach about 1/4 inch in length with flat bodies. The bed bug is a parasite that feeds on the blood of humans and other animals. Yes, bed bugs can even make your pets miserable.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How do you get bed bugs?',
					'answer': 'While bed bugs became rare in the 1950s, they have been re-introduced into the US, particularly via international ports of entry. Bed bugs reproduce and spread quickly, traveling in clothing and baggage. A bed bug infestation can start almost anywhere: at home, a hotel, or even in public places such as busses, airports, or train stations. Because they travel frequently, bed bugs can thrive in any environment, even very clean ones. For example, bed bugs have been showing up in upscale hotels, resulting in lawsuits by guests who have suffered serious bites, itching, and skin rashes from their presence.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How do I know if I have bed bugs (symptoms of bites)?',
					'answer': 'Typically, skin bitten by bed bugs is reddish with small spots that look like mosquito bites or flea bites. Bed bugs don’t inject any kind of venom and aren’t believed to carry infectious microbes, however, they can induce their own saliva into the bites. While bed bugs feed, their saliva dulls pain, but can cause mild allergic reactions later on. The result can be mild to severe itching and vigorous scratching that can, in turn, cause infections. It’s easy to mistake bed bug bites for flea bites especially since, like fleas, a bed bug infestation will leave dark fecal spots on bed sheets or in their hiding places.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How do I get rid of bed bugs?',
					'answer': 'Getting rid of bed bugs is very difficult; you must act fast! While insecticides and other chemicals can be used, infected mattresses must be discarded afterwards. We will apply treatments based on the level of infestation. Plus you can use rooms immediately after they’ve been treated! Our bed bug treatments leave behind no residue and are completely safe for furniture, computers, and other sensitive home and office accessories.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Why does it take more than one treatment for fleas, ticks and bed bugs?',
					'answer': 'Fleas, ticks and bed bugs have different life cycles than other targeted species.  During certain phases of their life cycle they do not succumb to treatments, so we have to “catch” them between these dormant cycles in order to attain management.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What does “green pest control” mean?',
					'answer': 'We have developed a pest control program that is totally chemical free, and that can be applied under a set of conditions. Under our “green” treatments, every product that we would use in your home is an environmentally friendly product and puts no risk to your children or pets.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What are the more common aspects of a green control program?',
					'answer': 'Facilitating habitat modifications.<br /> Initiating the reduction of food, water and harborage sources.<br /> Utilizing plant-based materials.<br /> Utilizing reduced-risk pesticides per EPA regulations.<br /> Thoroughly de-webbing exteriors to reduce spider populations.<br /> Installing interior monitors to catch inside offenders and accurately identify them.<br /> Using accurate identifications to prescribe the most effective, safest treatments.<br /> Practicing transparency with respect to all company practices.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Can we expect the same type of control using green products instead of chemicals?',
					'answer': 'We will apply methods that will ensure that you are given a pest free home. Some of those things would be sealing entry points, deterring pest breeding sites, and eliminating food and water sources for pests.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'We have had other companies come out and promise us great results and not live up to what they promised, what makes you different?',
					'answer': 'It starts with being family and operated, while not every employee is a family member by blood, all have known our family for at least 10 year and you can rest assured that every tech will give you the best service they can!'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Will you still spray the home inside and out?',
					'answer': 'We will always treat the outside of the home as a preventative method against insects getting into the home, the inside is optional, but since we are using green products it is encouraged.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Does green pest control cost the same?',
					'answer': 'We are going to do everything we can to keep the price close to our regular pest control service. However more time and evaluation is spent in the green pest program and such is reflected in our prices.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Is there a year contract and do we have to pay in advance?',
					'answer': 'We do not require any contract and also do not require payment in advance, should you want to pay the year in advance you will receive a slight discount.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Will I have the same technician from the time I start till I finish?',
					'answer': 'In rare occasions, such as the birth of a child we will have another technician out in our place, but 99% of the time the technician who started the service with you will continue it!'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Are there any insects that aren’t treated with green products?',
					'answer': 'At this time we cannot use green pest products on cockroaches or bed bugs, because we haven’t seen a product that can do 100% control of these two insects.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Is green pest control a better option for me than your regular pest control service?',
					'answer': 'If you worry about the effects of pest control products in your home with regards to family or pets, than our green pest program is absolutely right for you! This is worry-free pest control!'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How do you treat for cockroaches?',
					'answer': 'Cockroaches have long been one of the most common household pests. We’ve developed years of expertise in solving cockroach problems. Our control strategy depends upon the species of cockroach, which is why inspection and identification is an important first step. Upon identification of the species and analysis of the situation, a strategy is developed. Rose technicians utilize baits, carefully placed out of reach of children and pets, to eliminate cockroach populations. In other situations, insect growth regulators, which inhibit the ability of the cockroach to molt and grow, are used in combination with other methods. And additionally, we provide information to clients about the ways that they can minimize pest immigration and avoid providing harborage for pest populations. So you see, cockroach control is really best achieved through a combination of techniques – an “integrated” approach to pest management.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How does your rodent control service work?',
					'answer': 'The house mouse is one of the most common pests triggering a call to BugCleaners. They are best dealt with using an integrated approach including exclusion, sanitation, and population reduction. Usually traps are employed to eliminate mice living inside buildings, but rodenticide baits occasionally have some utility as well. Each account should be inspected and assessed for the best approach to use at each home/building.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Why am I seeing more pest activity after my service?',
					'answer': 'Depending on the materials used, it is common to see an increase in activity following service. Some materials are actually designed to attract pests because they share it with others in their nest. The increase in activity will subside over time as more pests die from feeding on the bait. Increased pest sightings are also common after service because the pests are exposed to a material that is an irritant.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How long after a treatment should I wait before calling for additional service?',
					'answer': 'It generally takes 7 to 10 days for most services to be fully effective. We recommend giving the materials 7 to 10 days to work before calling to request an additional service. Certainly, if you have concerns or are in doubt, please contact us.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Why are baits often more effective than sprays?',
					'answer': 'Spray products break down fairly quickly in most cases, and must be contacted by the target insect in order to be effective.  However, baits work on both the bugs you see and the bugs you don’t see.  Ants, for example, will bring the bait back to their nest and spread it throughout the colony.  This leads to a more effective and efficient pest control system with results you can really see.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What is the connection between pests and asthma in children?',
					'answer': 'Cockroaches are a leading trigger of allergies and asthma attacks. The pests’ saliva, droppings and decomposing bodies contain allergen proteins known to trigger allergies and increase the severity of asthma symptoms, especially in children.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'How can professional pest control help alleviate asthma?',
					'answer': 'Proper pest control will help prevent or remove pests that can trigger asthma. A BugCleaners pest management professional (often referred to as an exterminator) can inspect a home for these pests, treat eliminate them and provide homeowners with recommendations to prevent reinfestation.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What do you do for the treatment of termites?',
					'answer': 'BugCleaners will perform a complete inspection of the structure to determine the extent of the termite activity. We then put together a treatment plan to treat the structure taking in to account the structure type and termite infestation. We utilize many methods from liquid applications, termite bait stations, foaming wall voids and boracare applications. Some treatments require one method, while others require a combination of treatment methods.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'What do you do for carpenter ants?',
					'answer': 'BugCleaners inspects the structure to determine where any activity is heavy or if there may be satellite ant nests. We then perform a treatment to the exterior and interior of the home with liquids, bait gels and other products if needed.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Do I have to stay on a program or will one service solve our problem?',
					'answer': 'We provide one-time services and maintenance programs. It is your property we can only advise you from our experience, the inspection, and your needs what might be best. Those who have maintenance programs really enjoy the results of the service as well as the service we provide when they have a need. (It fits in the budget as well)!'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Do I need to prep for the service?',
					'answer': 'Some services require no preparation from the owner other than access, while other services require more preparation – such as our bed bug and flea evaluations and treatments. Regardless of what treatments we ultimately recommend, the first step is always an evaluation of the premises (residential or commercial) by one or more of our technicians.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Is it always necessary to get the interior of my home treated?',
					'answer': 'No, as long as you are not having any trouble on the interior of your home.'
				},
				{
					'question': 'Will the chemical cause harm to my children or pets?',
					'answer': 'Here at BugCleaners, we look at every home on an individual basis taking each homeowner’s situation into consideration. If you have children or pets we will use the safest most effective methods available to treat your home with safety being our number one concern.'
